# Snapshot Drift Detector

Compares expected and actual snapshot schedules to catch policy drift.

Focus: Backup-platform DevSecOps governance.

Built as a small, runnable Python project with clear input, output, sample data, and tests.

## Run

```bash
python3 snapshot_drift.py sample_snapshots.csv
```

## Verify

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover . -v
```

## Local verification

Run `make verify` with Make and Python 3 installed. The target runs the documented sample through the project CLI. It also runs the existing Python unit tests.

## Business problem

A snapshot schedule can drift gradually from its intended cadence, increasing the time between recovery points.

## Run the project

### Local setup

Run `make verify` with Python 3 and Make installed.

### CLI usage

```sh
python3 snapshot_drift.py sample_snapshots.csv
```

### Replay usage

Run `make replay` to replay the checked-in inputs. The runner compares stdout with the baseline, reports differences, and exits nonzero on regression.
